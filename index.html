	<h1>There is project planning; and then there is project reality.</h1>
		<a>Welcome to BitC.</a>
	
	<h1>Hosts will act as forks of the platform that can sovereignly sail wherever they please.</h1>
	
	<h1>Developers will also be granted unlimited freedoms with their choices in focus and direction.</h1>
	<a>BitC comprises of a modular, deployable framework -- rather living in a proprietary container.  Therefore, at this time, everything found here can be managed locally and/or forgotten about, with users taking what is needed from the main deployment; as it updates over time.</a>
	
	<h1>The open source format will guide the the development flow toward a crowdfunded materialization of Business Service Taxiing</h1>
	<a>Our hope is to collaberate and form the software tools (of every nature) which will enable all hosts and devs to uniquely control any aspect within their own implementation of BitC.  BitC itself shall metaphorically form a virtual vehicle that can enable anyone with particular knowledge to connect with desired resources.  Examples of proposed use-cases below!</a>
		
	<p>
		3-service provider framework:
			A farmer has some open land, he lists the location, and some commodities X Y Z.
		
			An Entrepeneur needs a unique source of cacti grown with lab monitors, perhaps inside custom clay pots, or with controlled nutrition, and watering, etc.
		
			An engineer has a fully-automated, deployable farm system that offers guaranteed conditions (either operating conditions such as location, deployement options like rental or purchase, and product conditions such as humidity, requirements like power and water) with listed conditions XYZ (conditions will include pricing of startup, maintenance, etc.)
		</p>
		<p>
		1) BitC will attempt to initialize a starting point between each party, that transparently puts them in direct communication with one-another
		2) BitC will then facilitate the formation of preconditions (such as terms between each party.)
		3) BitC will assist with setting up contractual agreements to lower risks for all parties involved.</p>
		
		<h1>While this system is currently under Construction, it will rapidly begin to materialize here in the near future, so check back each week for more info!</h1>
